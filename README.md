# dandrea-one

dandrea one theme is the color theme based on the one I've set up in Visual Studio and then ported to VS Code. Feel free to use.
 The font in the screenshot is [Iosevka Light](https://github.com/be5invis/Iosevka), although I also enjoy [Fira Code](https://github.com/tonsky/FiraCode).
